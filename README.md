A set of different uses for Augmented Reality in Dual Universe

-

Scripts must be copy pasted into a programming board

Programming board must be linked to Core and to 1 xs adjuster

-

For some, adjuster needs to have the tag Jero, check the unit start first,

and some will automatically deactivate while getting further from programming board

Check details in the unit start of the script

WARNING! AR 3D text scripts only take alphanumeric characters from A to Z and from 0 to 9
